			<p style="color: #000000;">Choosing a school for your child(ren) is 
one of the most significant decisions that needs to be made in the 
Aliyah planning process. Understanding the way the school system works 
in Israel will help you make a quality decision. Many Olim are 
accustomed to a private day school system in which registration takes 
places at the local school without any governmental intervention. In 
Israel, all schools are under the supervision of the local Machleket 
HaChinuch (Department of Education). Therefore, registration is more of a
 bureaucratic process than in North America or in the UK.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The following are guidelines for the 
registration process for preschool, elementary and high schools. Please 
note that there may be some variation in these guidelines for 
specialized schools and in certain cities. The registration process in 
the Charedi sector is different. The parents must request an application
 directly from the preschool, elementary school, Yeshiva Ketana, or 
Seminar (girls’ high school). Registration for the school only takes 
place once the student has been accepted to the school. Some schools are
 part of a network (Beit Yaakov, etc.). In these schools, the 
application process and registration are done through the central office
 of the school network.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;" align="center"><strong>Preschool and Elementary School</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Required Documentation:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Mispar Zehut (identity number) of each child and the parents.</li>
<li>Passport numbers of the child and parents are accepted in lieu of the Mispar Zehut.</li>
<li>Proof of residence in the city needs to be provided via a copy of 
the Arnona (municipal tax) statement that includes the family’s name.
<ol>
<li>If the family is living in a rental, you will need to provide a 
rental contract which includes the parents’ names that is valid for one 
full year.</li>
<li>If a family is not in the country during the registration period, 
they can give power of attorney to an Israeli citizen, provided that 
each child and the parents have a Mispar Zehut and proof of residence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Fees:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>There is no registration fee; however there is a deposit which will be applied to the first month’s tuition.</li>
<li>Tuition for Trom-Trom and Trom Chova (3-4 year olds) is 
approximately 775 NIS per month for 10 months. A Horaat Keva (standing 
bank order) form from the bank must be submitted. Note: Recently, the 
government announced that it was implementing a new law that would 
enable parents to send their children to 3-4 yr. old preschool programs 
for free. It will take 3 years (9/2012 – 9/2015) for the law to take 
effect in all cities. Please contact your local board of education to 
check if it is applicable to your city.</li>
<li>There is a 400-450 NIS annual fee for Gan Chova (kindergarten). A 
Horaat Keva (standing bank order) form from the bank must be submitted.</li>
<li>There is an additional 855 NIS fee for Tzaharon (afternoon program) 
in Trom-Trom, Trom and Gan Chova. Payment for Tzaharon is made directly 
to the organization running the Tzaharon.</li>
<li>Tuition for elementary school ranges from 500 – 4000 NIS per year (depending on type of school)</li>
<li><strong>Olim are entitled to a reduction of tuition fees of up to 
90% in many cities. A copy of the Teudat Oleh (Oleh Certificate) must be
 submitted. Note that this discount applies only to preschool tuition 
(Trom-Trom, Trom and Gan Chova) and does not apply to elementary school 
tuition.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Location:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>In most cities, registration can be done online (<a style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://www.cityedu.co.il/v2/SchoolBooklet.doc" target="_blank">http://www.cityedu.co.il/v2/SchoolBooklet.doc</a>) or in person.</li>
<li>First time registration (for Olim and new residents of the city) 
must be done in person at the local Machleket HaChinuch (Department of 
Education) in order to present necessary documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Time Frame:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Registration information is sent out in the mail in December.</li>
<li>Registration takes place in January – February.</li>
<li>Note: registration does not ensure placement in a particular school.
 The placement letter, which is sent out in June/July, names the 
particular school where the child will be placed for the upcoming school
 year. Placement is dependent on your address and religious affiliation.</li>
<li>After the placement letter is received, the parents are allowed seven days to appeal the decision.</li>
<li>A family may submit a request to register their child in a gan or 
school that is not in their district in addition to registering their 
child to the district school</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;" align="center">
</p><p style="color: #000000;" align="center"><strong>Junior High and High School</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Required Documentation:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Mispar Zehut of each child and the parents.</li>
<li>Passport numbers of the child and parents are accepted in lieu of a Mispar Zehut.</li>
<li>Proof of residence in the city needs to be provided via a copy of the Arnona statement that includes the family’s name.
<ol>
<li>If the family is living in a rental, you will need to provide a 
rental contract which includes the parents’ names that is valid for one 
full year.</li>
<li>If a family is not in the country during the registration period, 
they can give power of attorney to an Israeli citizen, provided that 
each child and the parents have a Mispar Zehut and proof of residence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Non-regional schools only require a Mispar Zehut (or passport number).</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Fees:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>75 NIS registration fee for the national entrance exam.</li>
<li>Tuition varies: 1500 – 15,000 NIS annual fees (tuition, dormitory, additional hours, transportation).</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Location and Process:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Registration for regional schools is done through online 
registration. Many schools may also require an entrance exam and 
interview for admission to the school.</li>
<li>Note: The online registration is to notify the school that the 
student is interested in applying to the school. It does not confirm 
acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Time Frame:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Mamlachti-Dati (religious): process begins in December.</li>
<li>Mamlachti (non-religious): process begins in March.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Exam:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>There is a standardized national exam for admission to non-regional 
(schools that are not restricted by a particular district) Ulpanot and 
Yeshiva dormitory high schools in cities throughout the country in 
December. The exam is composed of: Hebrew comprehension, math, general 
Torah knowledge and English.
<ol>
<li>For a list of non-regional schools <a href="http://cms.education.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/462E4FBA-BF1D-47E5-A1C2-4B977FF31DFB/120819/resource_1245745251.doc" target="_blank">click here</a></li>
<li><strong>Olim may ask to take the exam in English. The request must be made on the registration form.</strong></li>
<li>Children who have diagnosed learning disabilities may receive 
leniencies on the exam provided that they bring a declaration from an 
educational psychologist. &nbsp;For more information <a href="http://cms.education.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/462E4FBA-BF1D-47E5-A1C2-4B977FF31DFB/119875/3.doc" target="_blank">click here</a>.</li>
<li>Exam results are sent to the schools which were selected by the 
student. The school will review the results and decide whether or not to
 invite the student for an interview.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Admission to local Mamlachti schools, Ulpanot, and Yeshiva high 
schools are according to the dictates of the particular school and/or 
city and do not necessarily include an entrance exam and interview 
process.
<ol>
<li>Example:&nbsp;In Jerusalem, Mamlachti-Dati: students register online
 for up to three schools. The Machleket HaChinuch will place the 
students in a school according to the requests. In Mamlachti schools, 
students register online for their two top school choices. The Machleket
 HaChinuch will try to place the students in a school according to the 
student’s requests.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Pre-Aliyah</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Some schools will be willing to reserve a spot for a child before 
the family makes Aliyah. It is most common in schools that are 
semi-private (both elementary and junior high-high schools).</li>
<li>In some cities that have Olim coordinators, a spot in a particular 
school may be able to be reserved. Even if a spot cannot be reserved, it
 is important for the Olim coordinator to know the grade levels of your 
children so that they can plan for Ulpan hours. In order to reserve a 
place in such a school, it is important to be in contact with the school
 in the winter time.</li>
<li><strong>It is important to remember that all cities are obligated to
 place your child in a local school. If there is no room in the district
 school, the child will be placed in a neighboring district.</strong></li>
